/**
 * @mainpage Instructions for the developers of Libescdf
 *
 * @section intro Introduction
 * 
 *
 * 
 * @section style Coding style
 *
 * We follow the Linux kernel coding style (https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle) with the following modifications:
 * 
 * \li Indentation is 4 characters.
 * \li The limit on the length of lines is 120 columns.
 *
 * Yes, we are perfectly aware that these modifications are heresy.
 *
 * @subsection naming Naming conventions
 *
 * Here are some general rules that apply to names of variables, structures, functions, files, etc:
 * 
 * \li Long descriptive names are preferred, but common abbreviations (ex. tmp) or abbreviations were a clear consensus exists are fine.
 * \li Upper-case names are reserved for macros.
 * \li Mixed-case names are strongly discouraged.
 * \li Words in names should be separated by underscores.
 * 
 * We also have some specific rules concerning the names of files, functions, and structures:
 *
 * \li The name of the headers that are public should always start by "escdf" (see @ref c_headers).
 * \li Names the functions and structures should always start with the name of the file were they are defined. This means that names of public functions and structures always start with "escdf".
 *
 * 
 * @section c_headers C headers
 * 
 * All headers containing data that will be accessed by the users of the
 * library should be clearly identified and preserved from name clashes.
 * They are thus always prefixed by "escdf_". They also have to include the
 * minimum amount of data possible, i.e. the C headers required by the
 * exported routines (e.g. stdio.h) are included in the C files only. These
 * "escdf_*.h" headers are listed in the makefile in the "escdf_core_hdrs"
 * variable.
 *
 * Headers which are strictly internal to Libescdf do not have a
 * priori to follow strict naming conventions besides the ones from
 * the @ref naming section, but it is always a good idea to name them
 * cleverly, so that their purpose is known from reading their
 * name. These headers are listed in the makefile in the
 * "escdf_hidden_hdrs" variable.
 *
 * The headers belonging to Libescdf are included using double quotes,
 * while those coming from other libraries are included using the <toto.h>
 * convention. The config.h file is included in the C files only and is
 * always the last to be included, as it may fine-tune some already-defined
 * parameters and work around some issues. One noticeable exception is
 * the conditional including of headers, which should of course be
 * placed after including config.h.
